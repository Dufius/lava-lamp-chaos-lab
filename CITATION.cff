  An open research project exploring the limits of AI pattern learning
  using chaotic physical systems. This work investigates whether modern
  machine learning models can predict deterministic but unpredictable
  systems like lava lamp fluid dynamics, testing fundamental questions
  about the boundaries of pattern recognition in the face of chaos theory.
